<!-- <h1> Bio </h1> -->
<p align='justify'>
  I am an <a href="https://ukri.org/what-we-offer/developing-people-and-skills/epsrc/studentships/industrial-case">EPSRC iCASE</a> funded PhD student in Medical Statistics at <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk">The University of Manchester</a> in collaboration with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/">Microsoft Research Cambridge</a> through its PhD scholarship in <a href=”https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/phd-scholarship-europe-middle-east-africa/”>EMEA</a> . I am supervised by <a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/glen.martin.html">Glen P. Martin</a> , <a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/matthew.sperrin.html">Matthew Sperrin</a> ,<a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/david.jenkins-5.html">David Jenkins</a> , <a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/niels.peek.html">Niels Peek</a> , <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/population-health/staff/iain-buchan/">Iain Buchan</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sthyland/">Stephanie Hyland</a>. I am interested in both applied and methodological research, predominantly in the field of predictive/prognostic modelling. My research focuses on the problem of missing data and their handling across the pipeline of a clinical prediction model (CPM). My PhD project aims to explore the effect of using different approaches to handle missingness on the CPMs predictive performance, developed and validated using electronic health records EHR.
</p>

<p align='justify'>
I have got quite a diverse academic background – I hold a BSc (Hons) Biomedical Sciences from the <a href=”https://www.manchester.ac.uk”>University of Manchester</a>, where I have undertook numerous courses in a broad range of subjects including molecular biology, pharmacology and bioinformatics. I successfully completed a final year lab project at <a href=”https://paulshorelab.org”>Paul Shore’s lab</a> exploring the role of Runx2/CBFbeta in Breast Cancer and Bone Metastasis for which I received a First class mark on my dissertation 
</p>


<p align='justify'>
I was honoured to have the opportunity to undertake my postgraduate research in MRes Oncology at the biggest cancer hospitals in Europe, <a href=”https://www.christie.nhs.uk”>The Christie NHS Foundation Trust</a>, where I was part of the Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Lab, under the supervision of <a href=” https://mft.nhs.uk/rmch/consultants/dr-stefan-meyer/”>Dr Stefan Meyer</a>. During my time there, I completed an extensive research project that aimed to develop a cellular in-vitro model on acute myeloid leukaemia in children with Fanconi anaemia defect, on which I tested the effect of various chemotherapeutic agents, analysed, and compared my results from molecular studies with real patients’ data. Not only did I acquire various transferable research skills, but I have also received the highest marks on my project literature review (86%).
</p>

<p align='justify'>
Throughout the time I completed both my BSc (Hons) and MRes degrees, my interest in how scientific conclusions are drawn from original data, remained stronger than ever. Whilst I had a sound foundation in medical sciences, I identified the need to develop my interdisciplinary knowledge in statistics and Machine Learning. Since 2018, I have completed numerous courses relevant to the field, including <a href=” https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=07_MachineLearningStanfordSearch-ROW&utm_content=B2C&campaignid=2070742271&adgroupid=112394854539&device=c&keyword=&matchtype=&network=g&devicemodel=&adpostion=&creativeid=475480534925&hide_mobile_promo&gclid=Cj0KCQjwvZCZBhCiARIsAPXbajs8afBX8RLibobxee703Jb0JWCidWBGf2dtB67-GpBYmB2Wqbk_XAkaAkyoEALw_wcB”>Machine Learning</a> and <a href=”https://www.coursera.org/specializations/probabilistic-graphical-models”>Probabilistic Graphical Models specialisation</a> by Stanford University; <a href=”https://www.ucl.ac.uk/short-courses/search-courses/dealing-missing-data-research-studies-introduction”>Dealing with missing data by UCL</a>, <a href=”https://www.ucl.ac.uk/clinical-trials-and-methodology/education/short-courses/simulation”>Using simulation studies to evaluate statistical methods by UCL</a>, <a href=”https://www.keele.ac.uk/research/researchthemes/medicine/primarycareresearchthemes/biostatistics/trainingcourses/”>Statistical methods for risk prediction by Keele Univeristy</a>. In January 2021 I have also attended <a href=”https://health-data-hub.fr”>the AI4Health Winter School</a> in Paris, France, where I completed three days of plenary sessions and two days of hands-on practical workshops, applying ML methods to healthcare problems. 
</p>

<p align='justify'>
From May to September 2022, I was visiting the <a href=”https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge”>Microsoft Research Lab</a> in Cambridge as part of my PhD studies. During my time here, I performed an extensive simulation study, exploring whether informativeness of observation(s) as a result of changes in clinicians' observation, recording and coding practices, makes ML-models susceptible to failure during their deployment in health settings. In September 2022, I have also attended the world’s first <a href=”https://ccaim.cam.ac.uk/summer-school/”>Online Summer School exclusively focused on AI and Machine Learning for Healthcare</a>.
